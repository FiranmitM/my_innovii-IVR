🚀 QUICK START (5 Steps - 15 Minutes Total)
Step 1: Transfer Files to Your Linux Server (2 min)
Copy the entire asterisk-ivr-system directory to your Linux server:

# On your Linux server, create a directory

mkdir -p ~/innovii-deployment

cd ~/innovii-deployment


# Transfer all files (use SCP, SFTP, or any file transfer method)

# Example using SCP from your local machine:

# scp -r asterisk-ivr-system/ user@your-server-ip:~/innovii-deployment/
Step 2: Run Automated Setup (5 min)
cd ~/innovii-deployment/asterisk-ivr-system

sudo bash setup.sh
This script will:

Install Asterisk, MySQL, Python
Create database and import schema
Configure all Asterisk settings
Install AGI scripts
Create audio directories
Start all services
Wait for it to complete - It will show "Setup Complete!" when done.

Step 3: Create Test Audio Files (3 min)
sudo bash create_sample_audio.sh
This creates English placeholder audio files for testing. Note: Replace these with professional Amharic/Oromo recordings later.

Step 4: Test the System (2 min)
sudo bash test_system.sh
Expected Result: All tests should show "PASSED" in green.

Step 5: Make Your First Test Call (3 min)
Install a SIP Client on your phone/computer:

Android/iOS: Linphone or Zoiper
Windows/Mac/Linux: Linphone, Zoiper, or X-Lite
Configure SIP Account:

Username: 1001
Password: pass1001
Server: YOUR_SERVER_IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
Port: 5060
Transport: UDP
Dial Extension: 5000

Test the Flow:

Listen to welcome message
Press 1 to subscribe (if not subscribed)
Press 1 for Amharic (or 2 for Oromo)
Press 1 for M-Beauty
Press 1 to listen to lessons
Use * to go back, # to go next, 0 to return to menu
🎉 If you hear the audio and can navigate menus, SUCCESS!

❓ Troubleshooting
Problem: Setup script fails
Solution: Check you have root/sudo access and internet connection.

Problem: Can't register SIP client
Solution:

sudo netstat -tuln | grep 5060  # Check Asterisk listening

sudo ufw allow 5060/udp         # Open firewall

sudo systemctl restart asterisk
Problem: No audio during call
Solution:

ls -lh /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/custom/amharic/  # Check files exist

sudo chown -R asterisk:asterisk /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/custom

sudo bash create_sample_audio.sh  # Recreate test audio
Problem: Database connection failed
Solution:

sudo systemctl start mysql

mysql -u innovii -p'innovii@1234' innovii -e "SELECT 1;"
